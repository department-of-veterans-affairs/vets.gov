This repository is simply a guide to where vets.gov related projects live and what they are.

## Projects

### [vets-website](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website)

This is the main website for content and information on vets.gov. In fact, when you go to https://www.vets.gov, this is the code that you hit. In other words, it's the frontend that sits on top of the backend (which is [vets-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api)).

### [vets-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api)

Vets.gov provides data and services from a great many legacy systems. To make it easy to develop modern frontends (such as [vets-website](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website)) that are reliably available and easy to build, we've created a REST/JSON API that sits on top of all these older things. These APIs and shared services are in this project.

### [gi-bill-comparison-tool](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/gi-bill-comparison-tool)

Veterans can go back to school using the GI Bill benefits, but finding a good school is a challenge. This is an easy to use search engine for finding schools and educational institutions based on veteran-related criteria.

### [veterans-employment-center](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/veterans-employment-center)

Veterans have a lot of transferrable skills from their years of service, but it can be challenging to communicate this to employers. Veterans Employment Center helps veterans build resumes and find veteran friendly employers.
